#' Create Winset and Selectorate variables
#'
#' Creates the winset (W) and a modified version of the selectorate (S) variable from Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003) using the most recent data available from Polity IV and the Database of Political Institutions.
#'
#' @param PolityUrl character string. The URL for the Polity IV data set you would like to download. Note: it must be for the SPSS version of the file.
#' @param DpiUrl character string. The URL for the Database of Political Institutions data set you would like to download. Note: the link must be to a Stata formated file.
#' @param OutCountryID character string. The type of country ID you would like to include in the output file along with the country name. See \code{\link{countrycode}} for available options.
#' @param na.rm logical. Drop observations where \code{OutCountryID} is \code{NA}.
#'
#' @return Returns a data frame with the following columns:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{\code{iso2c}: }{The ISO two letter country code identifying the country. This can be changed to another country ID system using \code{OutCountryID}}
#'  \item{\code{country}: }{Country names.}
#'  \item{\code{year}: }{The year.}
#'  \item{\code{W}: }{The winset variable. The variable is the same as Bueno de Mesquita (2003) except the military executive component is from DPI, rather than Banks (1996).}
#'  \item{\code{ModS}: }{The modified selectorate variable. Instead of being based on Polity LEGSELEC, which is no longer create, \code{ModS} is based on the Legislative Index of Electoral Competetiveness variable (LIEC) from DPI. No legislature = 1. Unelected legislature = 2. Elected legislature with only 1 candidate = 3. Elected legislatures with 1 party and multiple candidates = 4. All other legislatures = 5. The variable is then standardised between 0 and 1 by subtracting by 1 then dividing by 4. Note: some countries were coded in LIEC as 3.5, so \code{ModS} has 6 levels between 0 and 1.}
