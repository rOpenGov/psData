\usage{
CountryID(
  data,
  countryVar = "country",
  OutCountryID = "iso2c",
  standardCountryName = TRUE,
  duplicates = "message",
  timeVar = NULL,
  fromLast = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame object}

\item{countryVar}{character string naming the country.name variable. See
\code{\link{countrycode}}.}

\item{OutCountryID}{character string. The type of country ID you would like
to include in the output file along with the country name. See
\code{\link{countrycode}} for available options.}

\item{standardCountryName}{logical. Whether or not to standardise the country
names variable based on \code{country.name} from  \code{\link{countrycode}}.}

\item{duplicates}{character string specifying how to handle duplicated
country or country-time observations (for the latter see \code{timeVar}).
Can be set to \code{none} to do nothing, \code{message} to simply report
duplicates, \code{drop} to report and drop duplicates, and \code{return} to
return a data frame with only duplicated observations (see also
\code{fromLast}).}

\item{timeVar}{character string indicating the name of a time variable. For
example, country time series often have separate rows based on a \code{year}
variable. This is used solely to determine if there are duplicated
country-time values.}

\item{fromLast}{logical indicating if duplication should be considered from
the reverse side. Only relevant if \code{duplicates = 'drop'} or
\code{duplicates = 'return'}.}
}
\description{
Function for creating standardised country names and ID variables based on
capabilities from the \code{\link{countrycode}} package. The function also
reports if duplicated country IDs have been created and lets the user either
drop these or return only duplicated values for inspection.
