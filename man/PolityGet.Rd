\arguments{
\item{url}{character string. The URL for the Polity IV data set you would
like to download. Note: it must be for the SPSS version of the file.}

\item{vars}{character vector containing the variables to keep. If

\code{country} and \code{year} variables are always returned.}

to include in the output file along with the country name. See
\code{\link{countrycode}} for available options.}

\item{standardCountryName}{logical. Whether or not to standardise the country

\item{na.rm}{logical. Drop observations where \code{OutCountryID} is
\code{NA}.}

\item{duplicates}{character specifying how to handle duplicated country-year
observations. Can be set to \code{none} to do nothing, \code{message} to
simply report duplicates, \code{drop} to report and drop duplicates, and
\code{return} to return a data frame with only duplicated observations
(see also \code{fromLast}).}

\item{fromLast}{logical indicating if duplication should be considered
from the reverse side. Only relevant if \code{duplicates = 'drop'} or
\code{duplicates = 'out'}.}
